		<title>Gampy busts loose!</title>
		<description>
			If war taught Gampy one thing, its always to keep your wits about you. Luckily for Gampy, he heeded this advice many years ago by tapping the calls of his loved ones. Last night he overheard his daughter Nancy conspiring against him. Nancy planned to stuff Gampy in a nursing home by the end of the week. He would have none of this.
